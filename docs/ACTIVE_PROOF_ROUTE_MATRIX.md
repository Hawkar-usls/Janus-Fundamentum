# JANUS Active Proof Route Matrix

**Purpose:** compare every new mechanism against the existing proof graph before
creating another hypothesis.

P_VS_NP=OPEN

| Cycle | Exact object | Verified contribution | Shortcut rejected | Surviving gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C023 | Boolean polymorphism admission | Exact Schaefer dispatch and fixed `{NAND3,NEQ}` obstruction | Separate tractable languages imply tractable mixture | Instance-specific decomposition with charged interfaces |
| C024 | Fracture channel core | Coarse region graph can be a star while exact elimination recovers arbitrary 3-CNF | Low coarse fracture treewidth captures hardness | `NONLINEAR_QUOTIENT_CORE` |
| C025 | Certified residual quotient | Separates residual-state volume from semantic merge-proof volume | Free semantic equality merging | `CERTIFIED_RESIDUAL_QUOTIENT_COMPLEXITY` |
| C027 | Context projection discovery | OR and XOR cones have exact but representation-sensitive projections | Compact circuit implies tractable projection | `TRACTABLE_PROJECTION_DISCOVERY` |
| C028 | Mixed-cone invariants | Decomposable NNF is tractable; overlap variables form a backdoor | Determinism, gate-tree topology and constant alternation imply tractability | `SEMANTIC_SUPPORT_OVERLAP` |
| C029 | Occurrence-splitting minor | Connected equality splitting preserves the source incidence graph as a minor | Variable copying plus equalities lowers incidence width | `NON_MINOR_PRESERVING_SEMANTIC_COMPRESSION` |
| C032 | PS-width alignment | JANUS cut signatures are exactly PS-width signatures; high treewidth can have PS-width 2 | Inventing a new enumerative cut parameter | `POLYNOMIAL_PS_DECOMPOSITION_OR_SYMBOLIC_SIGNATURE_COMPRESSION` |
| C033 | Proof-carrying tractable portfolio | Normalization plus exact Horn, dual-Horn and beta-acyclic solving with witness recovery and strict `OPEN` | Every tractable regime must first have small explicit PS tables | `PORTFOLIO_SELECTION_WITH_SYMBOLIC_MESSAGES` |
| C031 | Proof-carrying SAT refuter | Formal lower-bound transfer interface | Uncertified circuit counterexamples and free direct-sum amplification | `NO_SHARING_REFUTER_AMPLIFICATION` |

## Constructive P=NP track

```text
tractable local languages
-> exact semantic cut signatures or certified symbolic elimination
-> polynomial portfolio selection and cross-class composition
-> SAT witness + UNSAT certificate
-> universal polynomial SAT algorithm
```

C033 establishes a sound restricted portfolio. The immediate target is C034:
add a verified affine/GF(2) branch, then prove or refute polynomial symbolic
composition across Horn, affine and beta-acyclic regions.

## Separation track

```text
proof-carrying circuit refuter
-> certificate-preserving SAT embedding
-> no-sharing amplification
-> SAT not in P/poly
-> P != NP
```

This track remains useful as an adversarial control even while the user-selected
primary objective is `P=NP`.

## Non-duplication rule

Before admitting a new hypothesis, compare it against:

```text
PS-width
MIM-width / incidence width
DNNF / d-DNNF / OBDD
backdoor size
residual-state width
proof width and certificate discovery
beta-acyclic elimination
Davis-Putnam variable elimination
Horn and dual-Horn closure
GF(2) affine elimination
```

A renamed known parameter is registered as an alignment result, not promoted as
a new theorem.
